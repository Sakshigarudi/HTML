        and Latin writing had little or no space between words and could be
        written in boustrophedon (alternating directions). Over time, text
        direction (left to right) became standardized. Word dividers and
        terminal punctuation became common. The first way to divide sentences
        into groups was the original paragraphos, similar to an underscore at
        the beginning of the new group.[2] The Greek parágraphos evolved into
        the pilcrow (¶), which in English manuscripts in the Middle Ages can be
        seen inserted inline between sentences. Indented paragraphs demonstrated
        in the US Constitution Ancient manuscripts also divided sentences into
        paragraphs with line breaks (newline) followed by an initial at the
        beginning of the next paragraph. An initial is an oversized capital
        letter, sometimes outdented beyond the margin of the text. This style
        can be seen, for example, in the original Old English manuscript of
        Beowulf. Outdenting is still used in English typography, though not
        commonly.[3] Modern English typography usually indicates a new paragraph
        by indenting the first line. This style can be seen in the (handwritten)
        United States Constitution from 1787. For additional ornamentation, a
        hedera leaf or other symbol can be added to the inter-paragraph white
        space, or put in the indentation space. A second common modern English
        style is to use no indenting, but add vertical white space to create
        "block paragraphs." On a typewriter, a double carriage return produces a
        blank line for this purpose; professional typesetters (or word
        processing software) may put in an arbitrary vertical space by adjusting
        leading. This style is very common in electronic formats, such as on the
        World Wide Web and email. Wikipedia itself employs this format.</p>
