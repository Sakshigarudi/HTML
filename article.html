    <h2>Chandrayaan 3 creates history and more</h2>
    <p>
      In a sense, India did create history via Chandrayaan 3 in that it was the
      first country to land on the South Pole of the lunar surface.

      Fortunately, the event was managed smoothly this time around. The
      Chandrayaan mission has thrown terra bytes of data for the Indian space
      scientists to pore over, but more importantly it will sharpen our
      understanding of the mysteries of the universe. Thanks to legendary
      scientists like Dr Vikram Sarabhai, Dr Abdul Kalam, and Dr Satish Dhawan;
      India has a space program that is highly effective and has consistently
      delivered the goods in a very cost effective manner amidst the plethora of
      budgetary constraints.
